    <p> This page is kind of boring. Clicking on the canvas will create a red
      circle and it's going to travel across the canvas box. Clicking again will
      reset the circle's position and move it back to the left side. You have
      the option to make the circle stop but not the option to let it continue
      after you've stopped it. You can also clear the canvas. </p>
    <canvas height="500" width="500" id="box" style="border:1px solid"> </canvas>

    <button id="button"> Clear </button>
    <button id="stop"> Stop </button>
