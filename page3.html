    <p> Click the canvas to create a circle that will start growing in size.
      Once it reaches the boundaries of the canvas it will then shrink. You have
      the option of stopping its growth/shrinking as well as clearing it. There
      is also a fun little function of the classic bouncing DVD logo. Click the
      canvas to bring back the growing circle at any time.
